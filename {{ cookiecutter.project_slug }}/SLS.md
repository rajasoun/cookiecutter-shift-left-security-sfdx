## Toolz Radar

🚀 Tool Collection

### Adopt

1.  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development - desktop and cloud.
1.  [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter): A command-line utility that creates projects from cookiecutters (project templates)
1.  [cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft): cruft allows you to maintain all the necessary boilerplate for packaging and building projects separate from the code you intentionally write. Fully compatible with existing Cookiecutter templates
1.  [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers): Leverage Docker container as a full-featured development environment. It allows you to open any folder inside (or mounted into) a container and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set.
1.  [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli): Tool that guides the developer through the writing of the commit message
1.  [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint): Tool that validates the commit message following a set of rules and good practices
1.  [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks
1.  [gg-shield](https://github.com/GitGuardian/gg-shield): CLI application that runs in your local environment or in a CI environment to help you detect more than 200 types of secrets, as well as other potential security vulnerabilities or policy breaks.
1.  [git flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow): Git extensions to provide high-level repository operations
1.  [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged): Run linters against staged git files and don't let :poop: slip into your code base!
1.  [prettier](https://prettier.io/): An opinionated code formatter
1.  [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky): Tool that adds scripts (hooks) trigged before (pre-commit) and after (post-commit) your commit.
1.  [sfdx-cli](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.230.0.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_intro.htm)
1.  [cumulusci](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html)
1.  [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it): CLI tool to automate versioning and package publishing related tasks

## Quick Background about Remote Containers

Visual Studo Code [Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension allow us to use docker as a full-featured development environment.

Remote Containters allows us to isolate each project’s development environment with following advantages

1.  Reproducibility: Each developer has exactly the same workspace
1.  Isolation: Workspaces and their dependencies are isolated from each other
1.  Security: Prevents malicious dependencies from installing malware or reading your files.

Each project has a .devcontainer folder.
The .devcontainer folder contains the Dockerfile and devcontainer.json configuration for the development environment.
